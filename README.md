I'm a software engineer from Taipei, Taiwan that mostly do backend & data related stuff. Python is my go-to game but I'm also cool with (ordered by my familiarity) TypeSript, Scala, Rust and C++. Currently on my umpteenth attempt to learn Haskell.

Just finished reading _Introduction to civil war_, by Tiqqun, Alexander R. Galloway, and friends ([link](https://hardcover.app/books/introduction-to-civil-war)). It's OK I guess.

Gotta finish 25 books before 2027-01-01. I've read 2 so far.

GitHub says "usefulalgorithm/usefulalgorithm is a special repository", but every repository is special to me insofar as they've all induced different pain and suffering to my life.

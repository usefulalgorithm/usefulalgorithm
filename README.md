I'm a software engineer from Taipei, Taiwan that mostly do backend & data related stuff. Python is my go-to game but I'm also cool with (ordered by my familiarity) TypeSript, Scala, Rust and C++. Currently on my umpteenth attempt to learn Haskell.

[My personal website](https://usefulalgorithm.github.io/), mostly just my thoughts on music I enjoy or do not enjoy.

## 📚

Just finished reading _I Want to Keep Smashing Myself Until I Am Whole_, by Elias Canetti ([link](https://hardcover.app/books/i-want-to-keep-smashing-myself-until-i-am-whole)). It's OK I guess.

Gotta finish 25 books before 2026-01-01. I've read 19 so far.

GitHub says "usefulalgorithm/usefulalgorithm is a special repository", but every repository is special to me insofar as they've all induced different pain and suffering to my life.

I'm a software engineer from Taipei, Taiwan that mostly do backend & data related stuff. Python is my go-to game but I'm also cool with (ordered by my familiarity) TypeSript, Scala, Rust and C++. Currently on my umpteenth attempt to learn Haskell.

One day I will make this more fun, but for now this is it.

[My personal website](https://usefulalgorithm.github.io/), mostly just my thoughts on music I enjoy or do not enjoy.

Things to do in the (hopefully near) future:
- hook this up to ðŸ’©GoodreadsðŸ’© so that people can see what BS I'm currently reading. 
- hook this up to ðŸ’©SpotifyðŸ’© so that people can check out whatever BS I'm currently listening to.

GH says "usefulalgorithm/usefulalgorithm is a special repository", but every repository is special to me insofar as they've all induced different pain and suffering to my life.

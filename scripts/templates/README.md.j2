I'm a software engineer from Taipei, Taiwan that mostly do backend & data related stuff. Python is my go-to game but I'm also cool with (ordered by my familiarity) TypeSript, Scala, Rust and C++. Currently on my umpteenth attempt to learn Haskell.

Just finished reading _{{ last_read.book.title }}_, by {{ last_read.authors | join(", ") }} ([link]({{ last_read.link }})). {{ last_read.verdict }}

Gotta finish {{ goal.goal }} books before {{ goal.end_date.date().isoformat() }}. I've read {{ goal.progress }} so far.

GitHub says "usefulalgorithm/usefulalgorithm is a special repository", but every repository is special to me insofar as they've all induced different pain and suffering to my life.
